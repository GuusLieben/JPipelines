# JPipelines
JPipelines is a simple Java pipeline API making it easy to build and run pipelines. By making use of functional interfaces, it is possible to write pipelines in a declarative way and create controlled workflows.
JPipelines was developed by [pumbas600](https://github.com/pumbas600) and [Guus Lieben](https://github.com/GuusLieben) as part of the Tasks API in the [Hartshorn framework](https://github.com/GuusLieben/Hartshorn). It has since been [deprecated from the framework](https://github.com/GuusLieben/Hartshorn/issues/667), and is now maintained as a separate project.
